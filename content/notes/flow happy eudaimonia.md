   "I'm starting to get the feeling, that it's possible to be quite happy indeed"

   "Self-emancipation even in the West Indian provinces of the fancy and imagination, what Wilberforce is there to bring that about?"

   "Healing your trauma is the highest value-add thing you could be working on right now, because it leads to such deep paradigm shifts that affect every part of your life. Giving them more levity, breathing room, joy"

"Let me show you Jarred in anterograde
He is soft, and warm
And his eyes light themselves"

16-5-22 16.15: smiling at strangers as a practice

"How hungry we are for what lies beyond that barrier. If only we could twist the knob of happiness or contentment as we would turn our gaze or put our hand to a switch. We crave direct intervention in our mental affairs as intuition suggests is our right. The necessity of the long round about cultivation of the circumstances which beget joy vex us." (Daim past Jarred)

"This feels like runescape, it feels like my cousins house and staying up too late reading. Like naruto and pokemon red at the waterpark"

Most of my vibe upgrades followed the same pattern: changes in self-concept from new environments that treated me differently

conscious states exist
optimisation exists
optimising for conscious states exists
the question practically begs itself
for what concious state shall i optimise? and how?

Paleo sleep
   I'd like to share my sleeping practice which I've developed after several years of focusing on it and trying to recreate the pre-industrial (and possibly pre-farming) sleep patterns my ancestors had for millions of years before the last few thousand.
   Whenever I feel tired, I lay down to rest.
   Whenever I am sleeping, I allow myself to sleep until I am "fully slept", meaning I can lay there for a while, still physically resting, and not fall asleep.
   Sometimes this means only a couple hours, and sometimes it's 16 or more. Whatever it is, if I am tired and want to keep sleeping, that's what I do.
   A couple of times I think I was coming down with something, I slept for more than 24 hours with only pee breaks. And I woke up feeling fresh as a cucumber, as they say.
   Those flus and colds which I used to get once or twice a year and which would sometimes drag on for weeks? I can't remember the last time I've had that happen, but it's been several years now. (Of course, I have several other practices to thank for this, in addition to the sleep.)
   I also practice what I call "dog sleep" or "cat sleep", meaning I lay down and close my eyes and fully rest my body, without necessarily losing all alertness or consciousness.
   My rewards have been improved cognition, better health and overall feeling, and still being able to do occasional coding marathons like I used to when I was half my current age.
   We've been conditioned to think of sleep as laziness and sloth, but nothing could be further from the truth on the cellular level. When you rest, your cells go to work cleaning, rebuilding, and renewing your body. Your mind also does sorting and self-analysis, and returns the results in the form of remembered dreams.

   instead be universal, not a cult

- the idea that the components
   of your happiness are not obvious

Being in a world with others
   Heya, Be Present, smile üòÅ
   lean into the trying new ways of being

   "You know when you're dancing. And it's fun and you're having fun, but there's a part of you that isn't and is self concious and concious of the people around. Thinking about different ways of being is thinking about how you might not have that in that situation. And it's not just like, a knowledge difference. You're showing up in a totally different way."

   this new practice of feeling embodied while being around people is fascinating

   I don't quite know what is is
   It feels connected to that body high I woke up with on Friday
   Also with connecting with my inner child?
   Like, when I'm background paying attention to my whole body
   And I'm talking to them
   I'm speaking in a more earnest manner?

   idk, there's a fear that naming it and cognitising it will detract from it, but we don't negotiate with memetic epistemic terrorism so ah

   I'mma gonna think about it

Self-love is the most potent thing I know of for lowering how much you care what people think of you. When people want to care less they often try to stoically harden up, but it's more effective to soften and convince your parts they'll be loved no matter what others think

You know how every instant is a priceless gift but it's hard to appreciate that fact? When I'm meditating regularly I consistently, after thirty minutes of focused attention, drop into a state where I appreciate it. (My default mode network turns off too.) I don't know where my experiences fall on the nth Jhana ladder but I suspect there are meditative states way higher than what I've experienced. There are people who meditate for decades.

When I'm in a state of meditatively-heightened awareness I'm not just in a more blissful state. I feel qualitatively more conscious, which I mean in the "hard problem of consciousness" sense of the word. "Usually people say that high-dose psychedelic states are indescribably more real and vivid than normal everyday life." Zen practitioners are often uninterested in LSD because it's possible to reach states that are indescribably more real and vivid than (regular) real life without ever leaving real life. (Zen is based around being totally present for real life. A Zen master meditates eyes open.) It is not unusual for proficient meditators to describe mystical experiences as at least 100√ó more conscious than regular everyday experience.
