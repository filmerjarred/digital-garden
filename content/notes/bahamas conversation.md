   "I thought I was just going to donate to amf, but now I'm responsible for saving the electrons"

   "It's very hard to buy into EA and stay 'grounded'"

   "What would 'effective community' look like? How could we bring emotional and social abundance to EA?"

   "You're a valence realist? That's HUGE"

ðŸ’  thesis
   - many people struggle to take on existential levels of responsibility alone, they need a crew they can process strong emotions like fear with

   - EAs are set up to receive their validation socially, but are not socially connected and lack the means to connect themselves

   - social validation, friendship, existential peace are scarce emotional resources in our community with large inequality

ðŸ”ƒ dynamics
   Bahamas
      OPULENCE - This is so fancy and it makes me feel a little *is this okay*, are we allowed to be spending this much money. Are people talking about this?

      DARK MATTER - Who are the people we can't see? Not coming to the events because it makes them anxious

   EA
      EXISTENTIAL RESPONSIBILITY - What it feels like to take responsibility in the face of modernity (the emotional impact of thinking about electrons suffering and being responsible for healing it). When you take on "harry responsibility", the level of responsibility harry takes on for things in hpmor. "I'm smart and I'm going to win, if the electrons are suffering then I'll fix it". EAs are facing towards the terror of modernity, as articulated by Ord and Karnofsky among others.

      ABSTRACTION - In response to taking on this level of existential responsibility we're forced to use reason to chose where, how, and what to act, if it goes wrong we can't just say "well we tried" at that level of radical responsibility. Thus we are forced to work from the other end of some large causality chains.

      ALIENATION - responsibility + abstraction can produce a sense of alienation and disappointment. People join thinking everyone has it figured out and can share with them, but they can't. "having to justify you're existence to other EAs"

      OPA (OTHER PEOPLE'S ABSTRACTIONS) - Not only are we using abstractions and reason to puzzle out what the best thing to do, but often we're using "other people's abstractions", with deep hidden backings in philosophy, economics, or politics. It's one thing to say "do your own thinking", but if I'm honest with myself if Rob Wiblin says something that "sounds right" I don't think about it too hard, until I'm challenged, or I go to start acting in the world and I see that it's a lot of reasoning from other people. This might be more of a dynamic if you're working in an EA org, where you're *forced* to act under other people's reasoning?
         Q: When does "OPA" become challenged?
            - when challenged by another person
            - challenged by the world
            - by "a feeling", like "something about this doesn't quite feel right" but not having access as to what nor the environment in which to surface that

      FEEDBACK - Because we're operating under these abstractions that we've reasoned out, sometimes by other people, and sometimes separated from the impact by long chains of causality, it's hard if not impossible to get immediate feedback from the world. If you build a super bunker it's hard to get feedback that tells you for sure it was a good idea, all you have is the reasoning

      COMPETING PRIORITIES - EA isn't "rudderless" but it's also not heading in a clear direction, it's a decentralised swarm of people responding to the same vision laid out in some seminal texts so there's no clear one priority, there's a cacophony of forest fires and it's unclear what to work on.

      RADICAL CONFUSION - When you choose to take responsibility at that scale, you're taking on a truly massive amount of ontological confusion, when even the suffering of electrons are your responsibility one doesn't even really know where to begin. Metaphysical, philosophical, economic, political, social, physical, causal uncertainty, radical uncertainty at every level that you must acknowledge when you take on existential responsibility. Because something being confusing isn't enough reason to turn away, so you're forced to stare into the void.

      SOCIAL VALIDATION - Because it's hard to get feedback from the external world and you're operating under someone elses ideas, we look for social validation that what we're doing is of value thus feedback from physical reality gets replaced with feedback from social reality, which then becomes linked with dynamics of status and anxiety.

      ATTACHMENT - When people feel unsafe they look for others to attach to, and we see people becoming anxiously or avoidantly attached to EA and the validation it *can* bring. This can have damaging effects on the epistemic environment because people look to others are likely to defer to experts to get the validation they crave. people look for validation from a small selection of high status people.

      EXPERTISE - Due to CONFUSION + RESPONSIBILITY + FEEDBACK people look to key experts who seem to have it figured out, or at least not be suffering the existential amounts of confusion everyone else is. This gets all tied up in status dynamics

      SELF IMPROVEMENT - everyone in a process of becoming a person who can have the impact they imagine because they don't know what to do otherwise

      INFLUENCE AND CC - RADICAL CONFUSION + SOCIAL VALIDATION => Feedback from carrear capital is also social in nature, people don't know what to do so they collect influence and power, also gaining skills pople *say* are valuable

      ISOLATION - not wanting to waste someones time with socialising, can lead to people not connecting socially and also not being socially connected with

      INEQUALITY - People who show leadership or have social skills that can receive the insecure attachment of others gain massive validation, and produce an environment of inequality. Which can cause tension / anxiety, when someone is experiencing scarcity in the face of abundance

      INSTABILITY - If you're in an unstable hierarchy you're always on edge because you're not sure what could cause you to lose status.

      RELATIONSHIPS - I suspect this might interact with relationships, you can do the emotional and social processing needed in a relationship, especially in an EA one. All that can be hard to find in one person though
