"How do you foster secure attachment in a group setting??"
"What's the antidote to weird EA sex and drug micro cults?"
"What ideas could inoculate us against that equilibrium?"

I desire and fear to mix
potent ideas
potent drugs
potent connection
people getting high on ideas, drugs, and deep human connection, big things happen for better or worse

Big questions
   ‚ùì How do you foster secure attachment in a group setting? What can serve as mulch to choke anxiety?
      - It depends a lot what needs a person is getting met by that group
      - Don't turn people themselves into the project
      - Don't create hierarchical structures that enables people to judge others

ü•á Individualism
   a community that doesn't subsume individuals
   a community of radical individuals

   would then have to some some practical problems around
      - synchronising people's time and energy
      - shared duties
      - public goods

‚òØ Culture
   if you understand culture (in the sapiens sense)
   you understand cults
   the sapien has the ability to modify it's behaviour not just through the evolution or genes
   but through ideas in their head
   culture is ideas in the collective head that influence behaviour

# ü•É On Magisteriums and Cults
   - social reality
      - "creating a new and intense social equilibrium
         can go quite wrong
         ...but i still wanna"

      - A group can basically instantiate a "matrix" to live within that they control (if they do it intentionally, seeing the culture as object not subject)
         - A socially constructed ontology
         groups with cult level potency manifest a strong and distinct social reality as a shared resource
         this has high potential upside for people's flourishing

      - "I want a social reality in which I feel normal"
      - "status and social reality are big factors in cultiness"
      - "the ability of humans to live in a consensus reality to facilitate coordination is a core strength, and weakness"
      - the more insular a bash is the more neurotic it can become

      - welcomes feedback and advice and context

      - ‚ùó problems come when that social reality starts to clash with physical and emotional reality
         - "I'm not having an emotional experience of God, but that's clashing with the social reality I live within"

      - What if we emphasised "empirical norms", like, always putting things in terms of what we directly experience?

   - "keep things object level"
      - "aligning to actual reality"
      - maybe things get really out of wack the less you're manifesting (paying attention) in physical reality (aka the object level)
      - if tou stay focused on the world and your mission it's better mby?

# üîì Attachment
   - a dynamic I see is things going wrong when people feel insecurely attached
   - "if you're accepted by your group you can go out and use that energy to meet others"

   - "does your social reality ever sanction behaviour, or make people feel insecurely attached?"

   - "can you create a social reality where people are accepted just as they are"
      - OMG THIS MIGHT BE A CORE ELEMENT OF GRACE
      - "doesn't matter if the pastor looks down on me, Jesus doesn't"
      - Grace is not just "I assume that I am sanctified" it's "I assume my neighbour is sanctified"

   - "insecure attachment as weeds" and using mulch to prevent the weeds growing

   - **Omfg, if you're doing developmental community right, then being outside that community shouldn't be a strain, you should feel powerful**

# üí£ Leverage Research
   **everyone being everything to everyone can be both powerful and fragile**
   19-12-21 17.36: So we again run into the problem of a diverse set of people with diverse norms and paths and goals, all interdependent. If we were just regular co-workers, the issue wouldn‚Äôt be that big of a deal, but because we‚Äôre in this bubble together, the stakes are higher on trying to figure out which view makes more sense or whether there‚Äôs a compromise to be made.

   20-12-21 10.32: My advice to leaders would be to encourage people to take care of as many of their personal goals outside of the project as possible: take a yoga class, visit your family for the holidays, write poetry and post it on your instagram, make time to stay connected with your friends, figure out what sparks joy and make sure you‚Äôre getting enough of that. Because the more pieces of people‚Äôs plans that have to go through the project (or really any centralized thing), the higher the stakes and the more conflict will arise from people‚Äôs paths being in a frequent state of threat (even from aspects that you wouldn‚Äôt have guessed would conflict with someone‚Äôs implicit/underlying plans)

   - narrowing your need for validation and understanding and wellbeing to less and less people is dangerous
   - putting all yours eggs in one basket is a recipe for a cult
   - "don't pick just one person, don't pick just one project. else things can get weeeiirrrdd"

   - "how can you have people be more to more people while not being everything"
   - "maybe it's about whether or not people know how to d that, how to sing coombaya, if they know the song"

   - "when it's good it's good. when it's bad people have psychotic breaks"

   **refactoring broad swaths of social reality can be good, but it takes a lot of investment, especially with many people**
   19-12-21 18.57: This side-stepping [of societal norms] is often straightforwardly good, but it foregoes the benefit of broader society having weighed in and having provided some guidelines/guardrails (that are imperfect and often stifling/repressive, but at least relatively easy to follow), and instead forces individuals to hash issues out with one another more directly.

   **a group that lives or dies on it's ability to work through interpersonal dynamics needs slack**
   20-12-21 10.01: For good/stable psychological change there needs to be a lot of space for different routes and possibilities, even if you don‚Äôt actually pursue them; once you‚Äôve worked the knot out, you might end up continuing to do something quite similar to what you were already doing.

   **unconditional acceptance is a big deal**
   20-12-21 10.08: On the advice front: be careful creating situations where people are in vulnerable relationships with people who don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt accept them as they are -- interpersonal dynamics are so complicated that it‚Äôs often not enough to care about the person or even to want what‚Äôs best for them.

   20-12-21 10.37: We all want to be loved and accepted for who we are without doing anything special to earn that love or acceptance, but as a society, we don‚Äôt have a good framework for that ‚Äî there are built-in assumptions about needing to contribute/accomplish as well as needing to be special (which adds a tricky comparative/competitive element) and I think those dynamics add complexity to thinking and talking about and participating in ambitious plans to improve the world.

   - the entire dynamic of being defunded created a situation that fostered insecure attachment that tore the project apart

   **this is worth attempting**
   20-12-21 10.33: If we do need some people to be willing to attempt challenging novel feats, necessarily risking failure, it seems quite counterproductive to publicly shame the people who actually put in that effort.

   **others**
      - empower people with backup plans
      - don't attack their self efficacy
      - do all that you can to limit desperation and people's *reliance* on the project
      - don't operate in secrecy, try to maintain transparency
