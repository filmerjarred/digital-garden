title: "🌸 Bloom House"
---

1. Finding a group of people interested in taking deliberate steps to be happier and more productive [[bloom-house]]

2. All moving in together (or at least close by) and make an earnest iterative attempt to flourish harder together 
   - [[flow happy eudaimonia]]
   - (meet every sunday, review how personal and collective goals are going)

3. Over time go deeper and deeper with one another, increasing in mutual understanding, acceptance, and secure attachment [[rocks in the stream]] [[thinking on cults]]
