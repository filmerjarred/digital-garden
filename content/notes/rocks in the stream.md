"on dissolving insecurities"

I've been thinking recently about an interpersonal situation I've been seeing more and more in my life:

1. I notice when I interact with a person, I experience an emotion I don't like. (Anxiety, insecurity, annoyance, boredom)
2. Over time an urge to tell them and talk it through builds
3. Finally I snap, and an awkward conversation ensues which sometimes resolves the emotion, and sometimes does not.

Examples:

* A boss who gives unhelpful feedback, leading to resentment
* A partner who becomes combative when discussing certain topics, leading to fear
* A friend you've been weirdly aware of making and breaking eye contact with, leading to vague un-comfortability
* A family member who monopolises conversation, leading to insecurity

What follows are some insights I've had into the dynamic of how these emotions form, what effects they can have, and different approaches to dissolving them.

# üóª Fake Framework: Rocks in the stream

Sometimes i find it helpful to think about relationships as streams of water passing between two people to form a river, where the water is made of everything that they're giving you, and you them. Eye contact, facial expression, body language, attention, how easy scheduling is, how many jokes they're making at your expense, how happy they are to share power in setting a conversational agenda.

As I'll talk about later over-analysing what someone is giving you is a recipe for anxiety, but it's worth noting that these feelings that arise are not arbitrary. You're not crazy, the sense that something has changed is coming from *somewhere*.

I've started to think about things that arise between people as *rocks in the stream*, because very often you don't even start out knowing it's there. *The water just starts to move differently*. 

The rock can be on either persons side of the stream, but both experience the disruption in the flow

Sometimes one person has the power to excises the rock on their own, and sometimes it requires two people

Sometimes it changes what one person is giving the other, often both

Which leads to the perennial question 

"is it always okay to bring things to others, to attempt to dissolve rocks in the stream between you when you're unable to dissolve yourself"

and the answer I've come to is that my default assumption is that *it has to always be okay, at the base layer of things to bring up an insecurity or sense of disconnection with someone* 
And it might not turn out okay. They may be upset, or weirded out, or there might not be enough time and space to unpack everything and you'll just be left with a larger rock.
But I've come to the resolution, in my own internal constitution that I'll never judge myself for trying to voice my experience of our relationship. Because it's only from that base of acceptance
that secure attachment can form that allows people to hold and self resolve rocks without *having* to bring it up, without falling into painful anxious or avoidant equilibriums.

# üê∂ What to do when there's a rock
   - dregding budget (what an unlimited dredging budget looks like)
   - importing a rock from an old relationship

   - the layers on top of the mother and the greygound
      - "it always has to be okay, at the end of the day to communicate about a rock"
      - "because if it's not, if doubt can creep in 
   
   - the puppy
   - the dancer
   - the monk
   - the priest
   - the dashhound + the mother
   - the shepard (I'm wounded, but we're going to get you safe first so we can heal one at a time)

# üí£  How your thinking about the phenomena of rocks changes the phenomena itself
   - "this one of the core insight to thinking about rocks. The very act of looking for, thinking about, and trying to uncover rocks can create them. so there are ways of thinking about and uncovering it that make it less likley that they emerge"
   
   - the fear that trying to communicate will manifest an even bigger rock

   - being hyper sensitised to weeds causes weeds to grow

# üîí Secure and insecure attachment
   - mulch as being able to trust the unconditional acceptance of the group

   - I have to know I can resort to "the nuclear option"


   ‚ùì Is it always appropriate to try and talk about a rock in the stream between people?


scratch
         it's an odd thing when the rock in the stream is liminality itself

üìú Scratch
      My relationship with D has reached the rocky stage
      When I reflect, I'm reassured by the fact that all my close relationships reach this stage
      When the things unsaid between us build up
      And my felt sense of being around them changes
   
      Interstingly, it hasn't always required clearing the rocks
      Or has it?
   
      With K and S it did
      Ah, but, it did require at least a partial clearing
   
      An acknowledgement that I saw it too, but I still wanted to be with them
   
      My relationship with D has reached the stage where my felt sense of being around her
      Has shifted from it's initial glory, to pain and or fear
      Because we're triggering things in each other as we get closer
   
      We reveal more of ourselves, which is not only triggering but it morphs the gestalt and makes us wander if the person
      We knew originally was real
   
      The mutual triggering happens often with those closest to us
      Because we almost inevitably share deep pains with the people we're closest with
      And we see the hurt in them more clearly, which triggers us
