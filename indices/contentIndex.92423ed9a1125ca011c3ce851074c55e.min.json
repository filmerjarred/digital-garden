Whatever it is, if I am tired and want to keep sleeping, that's what I do.\n   A couple of times I think I was coming down with something, I slept for more than 24 hours with only pee breaks. And I woke up feeling fresh as a cucumber, as they say.\n   Those flus and colds which I used to get once or twice a year and which would sometimes drag on for weeks? I can't remember the last time I've had that happen, but it's been several years now. (Of course, I have several other practices to thank for this, in addition to the sleep.)\n   I also practice what I call \"dog sleep\" or \"cat sleep\", meaning I lay down and close my eyes and fully rest my body, without necessarily losing all alertness or consciousness.\n   My rewards have been improved cognition, better health and overall feeling, and still being able to do occasional coding marathons like I used to when I was half my current age.\n   We've been conditioned to think of sleep as laziness and sloth, but nothing could be further from the truth on the cellular level. When you rest, your cells go to work cleaning, rebuilding, and renewing your body. Your mind also does sorting and self-analysis, and returns the results in the form of remembered dreams.\n\nDavid's Project\n   - what would it look like to operationalise wellbeing???\n   biometrics\n   \"a universal framework for the dimensions of welbeing\n      in order to cultivate it\"\n   breaks down the inter-related factors\n   in a scientific / systematic way\n   insight-tracker?\n   \n   wants to not be centered on a person\n   instead be universal, not a cult\n\n   psycometric inventory / self assessment questions\n   weekly tracking of wellbeing across dimensions\n   bathroom mirror screens\n\n- the idea that the components\n   of your happiness are not obvious\n   to you is a counter intuitive one\n   the walls of your experience\n   become ossified\n   \"this is the range in which things can be\"\n\nBeing in a world with others\n   Heya, Be Present, smile üòÅ\n   lean into the trying new ways of being\n\n   \"You know when you're dancing.

When I'm meditating regularly I consistently, after thirty minutes of focused attention, drop into a state where I appreciate it. (My default mode network turns off too.) I don't know where my experiences fall on the nth Jhana ladder but I suspect there are meditative states way higher than what I've experienced. There are people who meditate for decades.\n\nWhen I'm in a state of meditatively-heightened awareness I'm not just in a more blissful state. I feel qualitatively more conscious, which I mean in the \"hard problem of consciousness\" sense of the word. \"Usually people say that high-dose psychedelic states are indescribably more real and vivid than normal everyday life.\" Zen practitioners are often uninterested in LSD because it's possible to reach states that are indescribably more real and vivid than (regular) real life without ever leaving real life. (Zen is based around being totally present for real life. A Zen master meditates eyes open.) It is not unusual for proficient meditators to describe mystical experiences as at least 100√ó more conscious than regular everyday experience.\n\nthat light bulb in the middle of me that's currently lit by the smiles of other people\nand my judgements of my own attractivness\n\nüìú Scratch\n   test: you can ticket dodge without anxiety. the thought of being caught and fined would be okay.\n   \n   \"When I was younger I used to be able to drink on a Friday afternoon with no repercussions and just jaunt on home, I loved it üò¢\"\n   \"True, but now you're older you get to conceive of projects that could bring about you feeling that happy all the time\"\n   \n   19-8-20 11.48: I suspect that caffeine is subtractive to well being\n   \n   \"Trying different ways of being\" - where a change in experience seems to occur at the level of (the referent of the cognito)\n   \n   8-11-20 07.30: the first task of your life, get off burning coal indoors (burning suffering for motivation)\n   \n   https://vividness.live/\n   \n   The feeling of giving yourself permission ri be tired ar Seb's movie night\n\n   04-07-22 16.41: [Nick on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/nickcammarata/status/1543560881543548928)\n\n#level-up\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-10T23:52:58.339093943Z","tags":null},"/notes/rocks-in-the-stream":{"title":"üóª rocks in the stream","content":"\n\"on dissolving insecurities\"\n\nI've been thinking recently about an interpersonal situation I've been seeing more and more in my life:\n\n1. I notice when I interact with a person, I experience an emotion I don't like. (Anxiety, insecurity, annoyance, boredom)\n2. Over time an urge to tell them and talk it through builds\n3. Finally I snap, and an awkward conversation ensues which sometimes resolves the emotion, and sometimes does not.\n\nExamples:\n\n* A boss who gives unhelpful feedback, leading to resentment\n* A partner who becomes combative when discussing certain topics, leading to fear\n* A friend you've been weirdly aware of making and breaking eye contact with, leading to vague un-comfortability\n* A family member who monopolises conversation, leading to insecurity\n\nWhat follows are some insights I've had into the dynamic of how these emotions form, what effects they can have, and different approaches to dissolving them.\n\n# üóª Fake Framework: Rocks in the stream\n\nSometimes i find it helpful to think about relationships as streams of water passing between two people to form a river, where the water is made of everything that they're giving you, and you them. Eye contact, facial expression, body language, attention, how easy scheduling is, how many jokes they're making at your expense, how happy they are to share power in setting a conversational agenda.\n\nAs I'll talk about later over-analysing what someone is giving you is a recipe for anxiety, but it's worth noting that these feelings that arise are not arbitrary. You're not crazy, the sense that something has changed is coming from *somewhere*.\n\nI've started to think about things that arise between people as *rocks in the stream*, because very often you don't even start out knowing it's there. *The water just starts to move differently*. \n\nThe rock can be on either persons side of the stream, but both experience the disruption in the flow\n\nSometimes one person has the power to excises the rock on their own, and sometimes it requires two people\n\nSometimes it changes what one person is giving the other, often both\n\nWhich leads to the perennial question \n\n\"is it always okay to bring things to others, to attempt to dissolve rocks in the stream between you when you're unable to dissolve yourself\"\n\nand the answer I've come to is that my default assumption is that *it has to always be okay, at the base layer of things to bring up an insecurity or sense of disconnection with someone* \nAnd it might not turn out okay. They may be upset, or weirded out, or there might not be enough time and space to unpack everything and you'll just be left with a larger rock.\nBut I've come to the resolution, in my own internal constitution that I'll never judge myself for trying to voice my experience of our relationship.

If we were just regular co-workers, the issue wouldn‚Äôt be that big of a deal, but because we‚Äôre in this bubble together, the stakes are higher on trying to figure out which view makes more sense or whether there‚Äôs a compromise to be made.\n\n   20-12-21 10.32: My advice to leaders would be to encourage people to take care of as many of their personal goals outside of the project as possible: take a yoga class, visit your family for the holidays, write poetry and post it on your instagram, make time to stay connected with your friends, figure out what sparks joy and make sure you‚Äôre getting enough of that. Because the more pieces of people‚Äôs plans that have to go through the project (or really any centralized thing), the higher the stakes and the more conflict will arise from people‚Äôs paths being in a frequent state of threat (even from aspects that you wouldn‚Äôt have guessed would conflict with someone‚Äôs implicit/underlying plans)\n\n   - narrowing your need for validation and understanding and wellbeing to less and less people is dangerous\n   - putting all yours eggs in one basket is a recipe for a cult\n   - \"don't pick just one person, don't pick just one project. else things can get weeeiirrrdd\"\n\n   - \"how can you have people be more to more people while not being everything\"\n   - \"maybe it's about whether or not people know how to d that, how to sing coombaya, if they know the song\"\n\n   - \"when it's good it's good. when it's bad people have psychotic breaks\"\n\n   **refactoring broad swaths of social reality can be good, but it takes a lot of investment, especially with many people**\n   19-12-21 18.57: This side-stepping [of societal norms] is often straightforwardly good, but it foregoes the benefit of broader society having weighed in and having provided some guidelines/guardrails (that are imperfect and often stifling/repressive, but at least relatively easy to follow), and instead forces individuals to hash issues out with one another more directly.\n\n   **a group that lives or dies on it's ability to work through interpersonal dynamics needs slack**\n   20-12-21 10.01: For good/stable psychological change there needs to be a lot of space for different routes and possibilities, even if you don‚Äôt actually pursue them; once you‚Äôve worked the knot out, you might end up continuing to do something quite similar to what you were already doing.\n\n   **unconditional acceptance is a big deal**\n   20-12-21 10.08: On the advice front: be careful creating situations where people are in vulnerable relationships with people who don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt accept them as they are -- interpersonal dynamics are so complicated that it‚Äôs often not enough to care about the person or even to want what‚Äôs best for them.\n\n   20-12-21 10.37: We all want to be loved and accepted for who we are without doing anything special to earn that love or acceptance, but as a society, we don‚Äôt have a good framework for that ‚Äî there are built-in assumptions about needing to contribute/accomplish as well as needing to be special (which adds a tricky comparative/competitive element) and I think those dynamics add complexity to thinking and talking about and participating in ambitious plans to improve the world.\n\n   - the entire dynamic of being defunded created a situation that fostered insecure attachment that tore the project apart\n\n   **this is worth attempting**\n   20-12-21 10.33: If we do need some people to be willing to attempt challenging novel feats, necessarily risking failure, it seems quite counterproductive to publicly shame the people who actually put in that effort.\n\n   **others**\n      - empower people with backup plans\n      - don't attack their self efficacy\n      - do all that you can to limit desperation and people's *reliance* on the project\n      - don't operate in secrecy, try to maintain transparency\n\n\n#elua #community\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-10T23:52:58.339093943Z","tags":null}}
